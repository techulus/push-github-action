# Github Action for Push Notification
Receive push notification to your devices using Github Actions

## Pre-requisites

To run this action you'll need:

- An API key from Push (https://push.techulus.com/)

## Setup

1. Create the workflow and choose any event of your choice.
2. Copy and paste the following snippet into your .yml file.
```
- name: Send Push Notification
  uses: techulus/push-github-action@1.0.0
```
3. Add a new secret `API_KEY` (your API key) and an environment variable `MESSAGE` (notification message)
4. Commit your changes!

## Sample Workflows
